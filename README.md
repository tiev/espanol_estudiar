# Respanol
Some ruby scripts to help learning Espanol.
These scripts are developed while I started studying Spanish.

**IN PROGRESS**: some might not be correct for whole situations but so far it's coped with what I've learnt

# What's included?
These scripts test your Espanol knownledge in many aspects:

* Get word definition
* Number
* Days of the week
* Months of the year
* Verb Conjugations

# How to run
You should have installed Ruby. Then bundle to install gems `bundle install`.

Then include library in irb: `irb -I lib -r espanol`. Enjoy studying!!!

I will published this as a gem when I feel it's ready.
